 Pulse Point — Quiz Web App
 Overview

Pulse Point is a modular Flask-based quiz web app designed to test knowledge across various categories and subcategories.
Each subcategory is represented by a dedicated Python module inside the /data/ folder — making the system easy to expand with new topics.
Questions are stored in a SQLite database, automatically seeded from these modules.

The app serves random multiple-choice questions, allowing users to engage in short, timed quizzes to boost recall, focus, and competitive learning.
